# life-calendar-wallpaper
automatically set and update your life calendar as a wallpaper (windows only)

When launch this script will generate a life calendar corresponding to your birthday and life expectancy.
Each number is a week, Red one's corresponds to past weeks, grey squares correspond to future weeks.
The calendar is aligned on your birth week.

To personalize your life calendar you need to put your birthdate in the "start" variable and your country life expectancy in "life_expectancy"

To automatically refresh your life calendar each time you start your computer put a shortcut of "life_calendar_wallpaper.py" in your startup folder: (press windows+R, type "shell:startup", press OK and put a shortcut to the .py in the folder)
